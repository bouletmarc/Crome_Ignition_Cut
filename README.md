# Crome_Ignition_Cut
Crome Ignition Cut Tool will add Ignition Cut script to your Crome P28, P30, P72, Gold Binary (.bin)

# How to use :

1. Select your Crome .bin

2. Select Add mod to add the ignition cut script

 - the file will be renamed (automatically) and saved to not override your original file
 
3. Set the rpm limiter as desired as you want, this can make the rev limiter hit faster than crome can if you set the reset rpm very close to the set rpm
 
4. Save all Change and burn the file on a Chips to test it out !

 - Most files cannot be opened back again in Crome tuning software after the script has been added, so make sure you add the script to a final tuned file
